# NextJS Boilerplate

Clone and use this repo to start a NextJS with Apollo environment for a frontend in your next project.

```$ git clone https://github.com/jordanrendall/nextjs-boilerplate.git```

Change ```sample.env``` to ```.env``` to use within the boilerplate. This assumes a backend server to interact with as your project grows.
